PDF/Xtract version 0.02
=======================

PDF Xtract is an enhancement of the PDF::Extract module.

PDF Xtract is a group of methods that allow the user to quickly extract pages
as a new PDF document from a pre-existing multi page PDF document.

Behaviour of the module is controlled by setting public variables.  Methods of
the module can be invoked with or without arguments. The methods will not work
unless they know the location of the original PDF document and the pages to
extract. There are no default values.

Pages to be extracted are specified by page number(s).

The following code can save paqges 1 to 10 and 15 from my.pdf to output.pdf.

use PDF::Xtract;
@pages=(1..10,15); $pages=\@pages;
$pdf = new PDF::Xtract(
	PDFDoc =>"/docs/my.pdf", PDFSaveAs="output.pdf", PDFPages =>$pages
	) ;

INSTALLATION

To install this module, just copy the Xtract.pm to your @INC/PDF folder.

DEPENDENCIES

HISTORY

First beta release.  Resulted from reworking of Noel Sharrock's PDF::Extract when
it was found to be extreamly slow! PDF::Xtract is at least 100 TIMES FASTER in most
cases.
